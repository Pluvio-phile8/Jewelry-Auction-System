            <h2>1 of 5: Our Goals Are Aligned With Yours</h2>
            <p>Unlike buyers who seek to purchase your jewelry and watches for as cheap as possible, F'RANKELLY is not interested in buying your jewelry at all—we are interested in selling your jewelry for you, to the highest bidder.</p>
            <p>Additionally, we believe that we should only be paid for our services if we are able to sell your jewelry and watches for the prices that you agree with. We provide fully-insured shipping, cataloging, photography, and marketing of your jewelry and watches, all at our expense.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, because we are only paid upon success via our premiums (and our premiums are lower than the other major auction houses), the more money that we make you, the more we get paid. Maximizing the value of your jewelry and watches is absolutely in our best interest.</p>
            <p>The group lot depicted here illustrates the importance of correct pricing. The consignor initially desired to consign the lot with a reserve of $10,000. We agreed that the lot was potentially worth considerably more than $10,000 but requested a lower reserve and starting bid and the consignor agreed. On auction day the lot opened at $5,000 and, as a result of prudent pricing, a bidding war erupted during the live auction and the group of vintage Chanel costume jewelry sold for $25,000.</p>

            <h2>2 of 5: We Have Solutions That Others Simply Do Not</h2>
            <p>While many auction houses hold jewelry and watch auctions every few months, we host live and online global auctions every two (2) weeks, allowing us to provide results for you in a much shorter period of time.</p>
            <p>Need money even sooner? We've got a solution for that too.</p>
            <p>Our Lightning Auctions, deliver auction results in just days. This auction format is a first-price sealed-bid auction where a list of pre-qualified bidders, who pay a premium to participate in the auctions, are presented the lots for sale and are allowed to submit their top bid, one time, in a sealed envelope. Once all envelopes have been collected, they are opened and the top bid is taken.</p>
            <p>The owner of the Rolex Daytona "Rainbow" shown here was not happy with the cash offers that he was given by other buyers. He tried the watch once at auction and it did not sell and was then looking for more immediate solutions. He consigned the watch with F'RANKELLY and we hosted a Lightning Auction for him. The Watch sold to a private client for $375,000 and the consignor was very pleased.</p>

            <p>The piece shown here was sourced from an important estate and came in with no documentation. Our team recognized the style immediately and arranged for the item to be inspected by the world's foremost authority on Suzanne Belperron, who, after study, provided documentation backing its authenticity. A prior appraisal of the item placed the value at $5,000, however, with the work that FORUTNA performed it sold for nearly $140,000 at auction.</p>

            <h2>The Process - from Start to Finish</h2>
            <p>Embarking on your selling journey with F'RANKELLY begins with a valuation and ends with a check in your hand (assuming we are successful!). There are seven simple steps in the process. If you need assistance at any time, don't hesitate to contact us.</p>

                    <h3>Step 1: Preliminary Valuation</h3>
                    <p>Understanding the true market value of your jewelry and/or watches is the first crucial step in your selling journey. The best way to do this is to obtain a "valuation report" from an auction house—preferably one that has an expertise in jewelry and watches, like F'RANKELLY.</p>
                    <p>Several factors play a part in the valuation process – the item's make and model, condition, age, provenance, quality, current market conditions, and rarity are among the most important factors.</p>
                    <p>The best way to begin this part of the process (and the process overall) is to fill out our valuation request form. Once F'RANKELLY's team of jewelry and watch specialists receive your request, they will reach out within just hours and either provide you with a valuation report immediately or request some additional information.</p>

                    <h3>Step 2: Shipping</h3>
                    <p>At the conclusion of "Step 1" you will have received a preliminary valuation report as well as a prepaid fully-insured shipping label (for US-based consignors only), a packing slip (to be included inside of the package that you ship to us) which will list the contents of the package as well as the insured value of those contents, and "safe packing instructions".</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Final Valuation & Consignment</h3>
            <p>Once the package arrives at F'RANKELLY's New York City Fifth Avenue office, the team will unpack the items and email you to let you know that we've received the items in good order.</p>
            <p>Following this, the team will perform a more-detailed inspection and study of the items and update the valuation report, if needed, and issue you a final valuation report. After you confirm that you are in agreement and would like to move forward, you will be sent a consignment agreement, which, among other things, gives us the legal authorization to represent and sell your jewelry and/or watches.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reason">
            <h3>Step 4: Pre-Auction Preparation</h3>
            <p>After consignment is complete, our team of jewelry and watch specialists go to work preparing auction catalog descriptions and executing any value enhancement services that might be required (such as obtaining a report from a lab or performing a small repair), all of which would have to be approved by you beforehand and all of which is covered by F'RANKELLY fully upfront.</p>
            <p>In addition, our industry-leading photo studio goes to work creating the beautiful content that we are known around the world for.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reason">
            <h3>Step 5: Pre-Auction Marketing</h3>
            <p>All items in an auction are organized into what are known as "lots". When lots are ready to be presented to our global audience of bidders/buyers, they are uploaded on our online auction platform and many third-party auction sites.</p>
            <p>After this, our marketing team begins their work promoting the sale and lots to a global audience.</p>
            <p>Interested bidders are allowed to "pre-bid" in any of our auctions, meaning that, for the two weeks (approx.) leading up to an auction, bidders are allowed to bid against one another—our online platform will reflect this bidding activity showing "current bid".</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reason">
            <h3>Step 6: Auction Day</h3>
            <p>On the live auction day, each lot is opened by the auctioneer, bids are accepted from online, absentee, and phone bidders, and winning bidders are declared when the hammer falls. Invoices are sent out to winning bidders immediately following the auction.</p>
